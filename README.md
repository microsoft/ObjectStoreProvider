# ObjectStoreProvider [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/ObjectStoreProvider.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/ObjectStoreProvider)

We developed ObjectStoreProvider after needing a simplified interface toobject storage/retrieval that worked not only across all browsers. We also have built a fully in-memory database provider that has no persistence but supports fully transactional semantics, for a fallback in situations where you don't want persistence (ephemeral logins, etc.)

# Differences to NoSqlProvider

This project has some notable differences to [NoSqlProvider](https://github.com/microsoft/nosqlprovider), and these differences are why it is a separate repo

1. Support for removeRange apis.
2. Support for getMultiple on any index.
3. Unlike in the case of ObjectStoreProvider, the inMemoryProvider is actually mutable. This was mainly done as we enforce immutability using typescript DeepReadonly types. Consumers should be aware of this while consuming the library. In the near future we will change to interfaces throughout the project to return readonly types. It is highly recommended that consumers add lint rules that prevent casting to <any> , <unknown> or operations like Object.assign() which will break the immutability.
4. Targets ES6, and higher ES versions for better performance
5. It uses red-black tree based indices for better performance of the inMemory provider

The rest of these changes in the library have been pushed upstream to ObjectStoreProvider as well. However, points 3, 4 & 5 are irreconcilable as it needs to be enforced across all consumers of ObjectStoreProvider. Hence this repo has been made separately.

## Compiling

### Source

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

### Tests

```bash
yarn install
yarn build && yarn test
```

## Testing

If a test fails and you need to run the individual tests, see which test command failed from the above run .i.e karma.sharedworker.conf.js, karma.webworker.conf.js, karma.browser.conf.js
Once identified, simply run the following

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test:debug:<target>
```

Where `<target>` is either `webworker`, `sharedworker` or `browser`.
Look through package.json for more details.
The default runner will launch both firefox + chrome in debug mode.

To iterate over tests, instead of the `yarn build` command mentioned above, run `yarn watch` instead.
